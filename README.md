# BirdWeatherStationMac
Small macOS application for accessing data generated from your BirdWeatherPUC; needs an auth token to access the server side data

The application requires macOS14 or newer.

Its a rather simple app I have built for my personal use and for learnign some concepts of SwiftUI.
Optional: For localization of species names it needs a csv file containing the localized name in the first column and the scientific name in the second column. Additional columns are ignored. See an example for a german localization file in Vogelarten.csv

Otherwise have fun and happy birding!
